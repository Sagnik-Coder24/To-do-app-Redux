# To-Do Task Manager

A React + Vite web application for managing to-do tasks. The app uses Redux to store and update tasks. Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed, edit tasks, and delete tasks. The app is designed using CSS for a clean and responsive interface.

## Features
- **Add new tasks**: Easily add tasks to keep track of your to-dos.
- **Mark tasks as completed**: Keep track of completed tasks with a simple toggle.
- **Edit existing tasks**: Edit your tasks at any time to make necessary changes.
- **Delete tasks**: Remove tasks once they are no longer needed.
- **Responsive design**: The app is built with CSS for a clean and responsive user interface, ensuring it works well on any device.

### New Feature:
- **Installable as a PWA**: The app is a Progressive Web App (PWA), meaning it can be installed on your device and used offline, providing a native-like experience on both mobile and desktop.

## Getting Started

### Deployment

1. Build the app for production:
